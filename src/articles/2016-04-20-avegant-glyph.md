About 2.5 years ago I backed a project about a mobile theatre system called the Avegant Glyph. At that time the Oculus Rift DevKit 1 was gaining some momentum. Unfortunately the screen resolution of the oculus was very underwhelming. That was why I was so amazed at the approach taken by the Avegant team.

You can read all about the technology behind the glyph on their [website](https://www.avegant.com/technology), but the gist if it is, that the glyph doesn't use regular display. Instead it uses a projector, which projects the image via a mico-array mirror, directly onto your retina. That way your experience isn't tainted by seeing spaces between the LED pixel array of a display.

After two years of waiting for an awesome product, I will be trying to produce a couple of demos or things to test the capabilities and limits of the glyph and will keep you posted.
