excerpt: "I held a talk at the local linzer stahlstadt.js meetup about polymer and the current state of webcomponents"

After weeks of bugging me, the local organizer of stahlstadt.js finally got me to agree to hold a talk at the meetup. 

I didn't really know what to tell the really high educated audience, that they wouldn't already know about and after some time to think, I finally landed on the topic of polymer. I have created smaller polymer applications in the past and after the release candidate of polyer 2.0 was announced, which praised their high standard-compliance of their syntax I wanted to try that.

I started to gather some info material which covered the basics of polymer and webcomponents and also compiled a new demo component. This demo component was implemented in three different ways.

* [Polymer standard way](https://github.com/tomheller/polymer-demo/tree/master/polymer)
* [Polymer 2.0 with ES6 classes](https://github.com/tomheller/polymer-demo/tree/master/polymer-es6)
* [Plain webcomponents after the W3C standard](https://github.com/tomheller/polymer-demo/tree/master/standard)

The results were pretty awesome, since there were not a lot of differences between the polymer es6 implementation and the one following the W3C standard. Although the convenience of having data-binding inside of templates cannot be denied. 

Thank you all, who attended stahlstadt and listened to my talk. It was the first presentation I've given since my thesis presentation 5 years ago and I was pretty nervous going into it. 
It was an amazing experience and I'm pretty sure it wasn't the last time.
